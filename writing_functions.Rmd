```{r}

```

## writing my first function!!

as an example, here's a z-score computation
```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean =10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

now, i'll write a funciton to do this 
```{r}
z_score = function(x){
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x need to be numeric")
  }
  if(length(x) < 5){
    stop("you need at least 5 numbers to compute the z score")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_score(x = x_vec) #put every x i find in the fucntion, to x_vec
```

does this always work?
```{r, error = TRUE}
z_score(x = 3) #cannot do with only 1 number

z_score(x = c("My", "Name", "is", "Cathy")) # cannot apply characteristic

z_score(x = x_vec)
```
